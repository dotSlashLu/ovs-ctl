#ovs-ctl

Scripts for install, init, and create bridge on CentOS 6.x

Since building rpm on CentOS 6.x is quite buggy for now(getting better with git
master), this install script uses generic method for building(make, configure).
There're limits of using this way, like the openvswitch kernel module gets lost
after reboot, you should do modprobe your self in init script or how ever, and
then start the openvswitch service.
